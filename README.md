# Frogger Clone - Bugs!

Kind of like the old frogger game but not quite.

## Getting Started

To win the game try to cross the highway and jump in to the water without getting bit by one of the many hungry bugs.  The difficulty increases with each successfull plunge into the cool stream on the top side of your screen.  Not only will there be more bugs but they may move faster as well.
